# The Modern 'Classic Aussie' Joystick
A modern inspired recreation of the 'Classic Aussie' MCA joystick.   This type of joystick was used extensively in Australian arcades during the 80's and 90's.

**Background**

This project was began over a year ago after seeing 3d printed examples from a good friend and exceptionally talented **cm_au** - who showed me how effective 3d design and printing can be in the 'real world' to not only replace difficult to source industrial parts but also improve faults in original designs.  

While completely blown away by they quality of prints coming out of high end home 3d printers combined with the inifinte possibilities from  3d scanners - I'd been musing over what projects would be a good one to get started on to learn more about the world of 3d printing.

I enjoy retro gaming, particularly 80 & 90's arcade / consoles, however I often found the affordable arcade based joysticks for home-use were nearly all based on on the Japanese JLF Sanwas or the American Happ style designs.  These often incorporated a large 35mm ball-top or bat-tops.   

While really enjoy playing fighting games using my JLF based fighting stick, I was keen to find something to capture the look and feel of the  joysticks used extensively in Australia (and I understand also New Zealand).

Unfortunately the MCA style joysticks used in a lot of arcade cabinets have not been produced for decades.   These were nearly always found in Lesuire and Allied industries (LAI) arcade cabinets lurking in australian milkbars (convenience stores), video rental stores, take-away shops, movie theatres, videogame arcades, bowling alleys etc etc.  

While they visually look different to the other arcade joysticks used in other countries, the main difference to their 'feel' was the lack of a spring - instead using thick rubbery disc (or 'bush' for a better term) to re-centre the shaft of the joystick.   

As a result they just 'feel' different to just about any other joystick i've used!

It is still possible buy old MCA joysticks salvaged from original aussie arcade cabinets, however many have not faired too well (either from being battered from years of use, cigarette burns, or the rubbery bush inside the joystick has completely worn away).   I'm aware that there are community efforts to recreate the rubber bush which will go a long way to preserving those still in operation.

However...

No one has yet attempted to design a completely new joystick that captures in part the 'look and feel' of these aussie joysticks using a combination of commonly available arcade parts (shafts, smaller ball-tops) and custom 3d printable shapes which will hopefully help bring them back to life for others to try out and compare :)



**More soon**
The first few 3d prints are now being tested, with photos to be posted soon.
