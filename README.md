# The Modern 'Classic Aussie' 3D Joystick
A modern inspired recreation of the 'Classic Aussie' MCA joystick that can be reproduced using household 3D printing.   This type of joystick was used extensively in Australian arcades during the 80's and 90's.


**Project Background**

This collabration project began over a year ago after seeing 3d printed examples from a good friend and exceptionally talented **cm_au** - who showed me the effectiveness of 3d design and printing in the 'real world' to not only replace difficult to source industrial parts but also improve faults in original designs.  

I enjoy retro gaming, particularly 80 & 90's arcade / consoles, however I often found the affordable arcade based joysticks for home-use were nearly all based on on the Japanese JLF Sanwas or the American Happ style designs.  These often use a large 35mm ball-top or bat-tops in their design.   

While I enjoy playing fighting games using my JLF based fighting stick, I was keen to find something to capture the look and feel of the  joysticks used extensively in Australia (and I understand also New Zealand).

Unfortunately the MCA style joysticks used in a lot of arcade cabinets have not been produced for decades.   These were nearly always found in Lesuire and Allied industries (LAI) arcade cabinets lurking in australian milkbars (convenience stores), video rental stores, take-away shops, movie theatres, videogame arcades, bowling alleys etc etc.  

While they visually look different to the other arcade joysticks used in other countries, the main difference to their 'feel' was the lack of a spring - instead they use a 'bush' to re-centre the shaft of the joystick.   

Note
It is still possible buy old MCA joysticks salvaged from original aussie arcade cabinets, however many have not faired too well (either from being battered from years of use, cigarette burns, or the bush inside the joystick has completely worn away).

**Goal**
To design a completely new 3d printable joystick that captures in part the 'look and feel' of these aussie joysticks using a combination of commonly available arcade parts (shafts, smaller ball-tops) and customised 3d printable shapes.   This is give anyone the opportunity to try out and experience a springless aracde joystick.

**Acknowledgements**
This project would have not been made possible without the excellent 3d scanning, modelling, printing (... so so much printing), guidence and support provided by cm_au to help bring the initial solution ideas and hand-drawings to life!  This also gave me time to skill up on 3d modelling software to further refine the look and feel of the joystick.   Also a shout out for monty on aussie arcade forums for posting his 3d printable MCA bush which was also leveraged in this design (with permission).
